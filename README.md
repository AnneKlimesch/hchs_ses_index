Repository describing the preprocessing of the socioeconomic status (SES) variables of the Hamburg City Health Cohort Study (HCHS) and the calculation of the SES-Index. Referring to the paper "The differential role of socioeconomic status dimensions in depressive symptoms: data from the Hamburg City Health Cohort Study" 

The code can be (1) used to determine the SES-Index for the HCHS and (2) adapted to determine the SES-Index for other samples. 

The files hchs_data_preparation.Rmd and hchs_ses_index.Rmd were used to determine the SES-Index of the n=10.000 sub-sample of the HCHS. This was used in the above mentioned paper.

The files 01_hchs_ses_preparation_17000_2024_11_27.Rmd, 02_hchs_ses_index_17000_2024_11_28.Rmd, and 03_hchs_ses_imputation_17000_2024_11_27.Rmd were used to determine the SES-Index of the n=17.000 sub-sample of the HCHS.
